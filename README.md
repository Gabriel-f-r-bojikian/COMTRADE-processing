## About

This repository contains a power plant automated fault detection programming assignment for the discipline [PEA3411 - Introduction to Electric Systems Automation](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=PEA3411&verdis=2).

This program consists of a script written in Octave that simulates an electrical automation system that receives an signals from a power line and detects electrical faults with digital signal processing. The input for this program is any COMTRADE file generated by an IED.

# How to install and run this application
## Prerequisites
To run this code you will need the latest versions of [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) and a COMTRADE file. I'm sorry that I'm not able to make any COMTRADE files available for use, but they are of sensitive nature and can only be used with authorization from their proprietors.
## Installing and running
```bash
# Clone this respository
$ git clone <https://github.com/Gabriel-f-r-bojikian/COMTRADE-processing>

# Move into the newly created folder
$ cd COMTRADE-processing
```

You have now succesfully cloned this application code to your machine. You should now add your COMTRADE files to the root of the directory that you just created. You just need to open your Octave application the corresponding folder and change the `filename` variable in the `COMTRADE_processor.m` file to match the COMTRADE file you are analyzing.

# Techs utilized
The following technologies were used for the completion of this application:
